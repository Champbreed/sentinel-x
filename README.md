# Sentinel-X: Vanguard Defensive Gateway

**Sentinel-X** is a production-grade, self-defending security gateway designed to protect sensitive data nodes. It bridges the gap between **Policy as Code (PaC)** and **Active Threat Mitigation**.

## 🛡️ Key Features
* **Automated 1-Hour Lockout**: Executes a mandatory 60-minute cooling-off period after 3 failed attempts.
* **Proxy-Aware Detection**: Identifies true source IPs behind cloud proxies using `x-forwarded-for`.
* **Zero-Leakage Secrets**: Uses environment variables to decouple credentials from source code.
* **High-Visibility UI**: Real-time "ENFORCED" status dashboard.

## 🚀 Technical Architecture
* **Backend**: Node.js / Express.js
* **Security**: Stateful IP Monitoring
* **Infrastructure**: Render
